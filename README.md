# GuessMyNumber-gfg-
A guessing game made in java for GeeksforGeeks

You start with 20 points. At 1  point you will lose the game
Math random generates a random no. Between 0 and 20.

With while loop,till the points are not less than 0, it will execute the loop. You have to enter the number you think is the guess number. 
The number should be between 0 and 20 else the loop will return false and the program won't run.
If input is greater then the guess number it will return value too high. If input is less than guess number value it will return value too low. For each wrong guess you will lose a point . If the input is equal to guess number , you won the game. Your points will be displayed. And with break statement you will come out of the loop
